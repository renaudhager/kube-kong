# Kong K8S Deployment

## Description
This repo contains files to deploy Kong as a standard deployment (not ingress controller). It's an easy way to put some authentication in front of your app in your k8s cluster.  
For production deployment it's suggested to run Postgres either on a stateful set or outside of K8S.
